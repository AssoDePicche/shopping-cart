# Shopping Cart

A simple shopping cart written in PHP with basic features. The focus of this project was to learn how to handle object serialization, unit testing and to practice object-oriented programming.

## Features

- **Object serialization:** you can save the current state of the cart as well as the item or product in a json or in a binary file.

## Future Features

- **Database integration:** I am planning to add support for saving the cart state in databases.
- **Checkout integration:** I also plan to add support for payment services.

## Composer Commands

- **composer run tests:** Run all the tests in test directory.

**Project Status:** In Development
